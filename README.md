# yegle's vim configuration files

## what's this?

This is my own vim configuration files.

You may copy & paste some of my configurations or just fork it. The code is in [Public Domain]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Domain ), feel free to distribute it.

## how to use it

Don't want to mess with your own vim configurations and just want to try my configurations? You can use [vim-reset]( https://github.com/yegle/vim-reset )

Here's how you can try my configurations:

1. `git clone https://github.com/yegle/yegle-vimrc`
2. `git clone https://github.com/yegle/vim-reset`
3. `export VIMCONFIG_DIR=$( pwd )/yegle-vimrc`
4. `source vim-reset/activate`

If you found any bugs in [yegle-vimrc]( https://github.com/yegle/yegle-vimrc ) or [vim-reset]( https://github.com/yegle/vim-reset ), please send a pull request :-)
